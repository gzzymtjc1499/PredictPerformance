# PredictPerformance
This is the study of my research master's thesis. In this research, I compared the out-of-sample prediction ability of 5 differnet methods in calculating factor scores: Sum Score (& linear regression), SEM, SAM, RGCCA, and LS-LV.  
The study includes 2 parts. The first part is a simulation study, with sample size ranging from 50 to 2000, and a sample size of 20000. The second part is a real data application, where I used PoliticalDemocracy data (Bollen, 1989) in lavaan package as the dataset. See the corresponding folders for details.
