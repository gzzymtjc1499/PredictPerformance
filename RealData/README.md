This is the empirical data application part of the study.    
The .R files started with '00' are the SAM codes in Dhaene & Rosseel (2023), without modifications.  
The `LSLVLASSO.R` file is the method of LS-LV in the study of Lê et al. (2024).  
Run the `RealData_Loop.R` for the whole part of the study.  
The results can be found in `RealData.RData`.
